/**
 * Links to other sites open in a new tab, except author links. Decided at
 * the click rather than written on each link, since links come from many places -
 * components, the manual and news pages ported from HTML, the plugin
 * directory - and one rule keeps them all the same. Done at the click and
 * not by marking the page up front, because marking the server's HTML
 * before React has taken it over made every link a hydration mismatch.
 * Anything on another host over http(s) counts; same-site links, mail
 * links, author links and anchors stay as they are. A link that already
 * says where to open is left alone. The browser still does the rest: a middle click
 * or a modifier click keeps its own meaning.
